------------------------------------

named web-server

Command

## 2
Example basic Dockerfile
-------------------------------------------
# Python v3 base layer
FROM python:3

# Set the working directory in the image's file system
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy everything in the host working directory to the container's directory
COPY . .

# Install code dependencies in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Indicate that the server will be listening on port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Set the default command to run the app
CMD [ "python", "./src/app.py" ]

Explanation:
FROM sets the base layer image
COPY . . copies all of the files in the code repository into the container's /usr/src/app directory
RUN executes a command in a new layer at the top of the image
EXPOSE only indicates what port the container will be listening on, it doesn't automatically open the port on the container
CMD sets the default command to run when a container is made from the image
